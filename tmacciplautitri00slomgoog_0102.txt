Aer 11. Scnnn 1.

In the following canticum or lyrical monologue Lysiteles describes

the troubles and extravagances of love, and declares his intention of '

leading a sober life. Notwithstanding his earnestness‚ he feels that
moral sentiments sound a little out of character from his lips; and this .
makes him use odd, almost comic expressions, e. g. 266 tuas res tibi
habeto, and 232-3, the enumeration of the familia.

Line 223. simitu¹ an old form equivalent to simul (similis, ἅμα),
occurs ten times in Plautus, and scarcely anywhere else. Iu two of
these places, Amph. 632, Most. 3. 2. 105, there is a metrical difficulty,
and Ritschl proposes the collateral form simitur, which is found in
inscriptions. .

224. indivisum, a componnd of indu or endo and rapitur, adipiscor
being the common form in later Latin; indaudirc (as well as inaudire)
is found in Plautus ; but this form of in is usually epici indugredi, in·
dupcrator, etc, are used by Lucretius, even indu manu (2. 1096) and
endo muri (6. 890). See Munro ou Lucretius r. 82. The active indi·
pisco occurs Aul. 768; Asin. 279.

226. exercitur. The last syllable is long here3 and this must have
been the 'old usage. as is shown by the genitive -oris and the Greek -on
Note the phrase magister exercitur (with which Wagner compares ἀνὴρ
στρατιώτης), the second noun adding a further description of the first,
and trans. ‘a hard task-master‚‘ the Greek παιδοτρίβης, or superinten-
dent of exercises in the gymnasium.

228. amem, ‘principle of conduct,' with which compare 74, artes
antiquonum, ‘your good old qualities,' and 236 amoris artes, ‘the de
vices of lovel

expotessam, ‘make my aim: a word found only in Plautus.
230. rei scans as a spondee‚ as Lucr. 1. 688.
obsequi belongs more naturally to amori than to rei ; but the
zeugma is not very pronounced‚ and the phrase is easily rendered ‘to
devote myself to love or business!

231. This and the following line are found in all the MSS„ but are
now regarded as spurious by most of the commentators. They cer-
tainly seem a weak repetition of the three preceding lines, and vitae
and aetatem corne awkwardly so close together.

233. nisi is often used in transitions somewhat abruptly, a slight
ellipse being the explanation: ‘I am not quite clear about the matter;
(orl shall not be clear) unless indeed 1 so act!
