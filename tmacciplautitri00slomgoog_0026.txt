were people of his time, ie. about the end of the fifth century
nn, who denied the existence of any metres at all in Terence.

Much light has, however, been thrown on this subject by the
labours ofmodern scholars, especially Ritschl, and one leading
principle has been established with tolerable certainty: viz.
that the scansion depends on the accent ol the word as spoken,
and not on any rigid rlrles of Prosody, such as were observed
by the Augustan poets. The versification of Plautus, as far as
Prosody is concerned, may be compared to that of Shakspeare.

With regard rothe pronunciation of Latin in the comic poets
three general tendencies may be observed :—

Ι. To shorlen the last syllable of a word.

11. To shorten unaooentsd syllables.

111. To contram two syllables into ons, called Synlzssis
in the case of vowels. ' ’

I.With regardtothe shorrening of afinal syllablewe have direct
evidence in some cases from Cicero, Quintilian, and Priscian.

(α) Α final -m was scarcely pronounced‚ and so can be dis·
regarded in comic metres. Cf. Quin ix. 4, 403 Priscian 1. 38.

(β) Α final -s was frequently dropped, and can be similarly
disregarded. Cf. Cic. De Orat. 48, 161. Marius Victorinus I.
p. 2472. Even as, os, -es, in acc. pl and -ls in dat. and abl
pl may be shortened: cf. 822, 868.

(γ) Α final -t seems to have followed the same rule, as dede
is found for dedit in ancient inscriptions, and there are nu-
merous instances in Plautus and Terence when a syllable
ended in -t is scanned as short before a consonant.

lt seems, highly probable that this tendency, clearly proved
with reference to some terminations, extended to others, e. g.
a final -c (pate is actually found for pater in an inscription), a
final d, e. g. in apud (the form ape being found in an ancient
glossary=napd), final ·l as in simul, final -n as in tamen. lt
is possible that even final -nt may sometimes have been
dropped, as emeru for emanent is found in an inscription, and
there are lines which seem to require it, e.g.'ler.T.nn. aba,
Ad 900, Haut 993.
