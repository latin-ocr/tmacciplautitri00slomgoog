108 PLA VT! TRINVMMVS. 1v.a.148-a.2. ⁵

ance,a practice alluded to in the epilogue to the Cistellaria. Later,
however, it must have fallen into disuse; for we hear (Tac. Ann. 1. 77)
that a proposal to flog actors was made in the reign of Tiberius, and
met by a dictum of Augustus, immunes verberum histriam. The
‘new aediles' must mean the aediles who had lately entered upon office
in March ; and so Ritschl proves from this passage that the Trinummus
was acted at the Ludi Megalenses, which took plaoc on the fourth of
April and the five following days. These games did not include stage
plays till amc 194, as stated by Livy, 34. 54. Therefore the Trinummns
was not acted earlier than this date.
