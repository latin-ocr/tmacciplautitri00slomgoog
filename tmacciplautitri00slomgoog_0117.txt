88 PLAVTI TRINVMMVS. 11. t.rr4-r3,

l. 5² 5. Acheruntis ostium· Orci janua, or in Homer Ἀΐδαο ritu
(Wagner). Acheruns (=Acluran) is Hades here, not the rivers
¹¹¹ 494·

526. vinum=uaa, while Horace, Od. 1. 20. 10, says tu biberussa

527. oonsuadst, ‘urges' i. e. not to accept the land; ci. 670.

etsi scelestus est, ‘rascal though he is. he is still faithful tons' ““
ie. whatever he is about is ior my good. This use oi at in the apo· '
dosis is common.

5²9· possid. It is best to write this in two words. The ierus
postidea and antidit (=anteit 546) may prove that postid antid were
the original forms of the prepositions, but not that Plautus used tham.

530. tribus antis minus redit, ‘yields three times as much less'
So Bacch. 1034 sescenta tanta reddam, ‘I will give back six hundred
times as much‚’ lit. ‘six hundred things as great.¹

illi, old form sor illic, often in Plautus aad Terence, e. g. Phormio
91, where the metre makes the form certain.

531. This remark, like 545-552,is put into the mouth oi Philto, as
an indication that he does not believe the story oi Stasimus, though he
finds it convenient to affect belief.

532. interficet. The only instance oi this form oi the passive
infinitiva

534. quorum, probable correction for quoium, ‘os those to whom
ithus belonged?

535. exulatum: exalatum, the spelling warrauted by A, may point
to the proposed derivation from aeolum. ,

537. ut ad inuitas redaotust, ‘has no longer anywhere to tum·
‘has not a move on the board‚' lit. ‘has been reduced, as it were. to
immoveable calces,' or checkmated; calces, or more commonly the
diminutive calculi, were draughts, with which the game was played. a
piayer losing ii his pieces were in a position where they could not be
nroved. Cf. Poen. 4. a. 85, where the phrase occurs, and also unam
calcem ciera, ‘to move a single piece.'

5 38. ex me, a correction for the MSS. a me, which is against general
usage. and easily accounted ior by a nu in the preceding line.

539. alternis, se vicibus. ‘every other! This is a correction on
metrical grounds ior the MSS. alteratae. See Introduction. xxiii.

540. The MSS. agree in giving sues moriuntur ancha acerrume,
which involves an awkward hiatus. It has been proposed to insert
acri, aa, or iili aster angam. Is either oi the latter. aramme might
be changed into acerruma, since acerrume mori isan odd phrase, though
alter ali not very unnaturai in the mouth of Stasimus. Ritschl reads aar·
ednod. Cf. 35 note. The penultimute oi wara is short (Greek ἀγχόνη).
