362. mentire, ‘you mistake,’ just like Greek ψεύδεσθαι. ’

565. multa illi opera opust flaturae. It is not likely that Plautus
wrote this sentence as it stands, but perhaps nothing better can be ex·
moed from the MSS.

opera (ablative) flaturae, ‘a man needs much practice in carying
vlo wishes to carve skilsully the course of his lise! For ae eoae
expetit cf. 324 volo mc exorare.
ξ 367. episomam asolitary instance of this verb in the passive sense.

bned (Lindemann, Mil. 3. 1. 155 note) to express two different ideas;
vetur=‘of old date,' antiquus,=·0f old character? as Pliny, Paneg.
