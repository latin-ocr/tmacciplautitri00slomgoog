xii INTRODUC T ION.

Umbria, about 254 B.C.; but the meagre notices ot his lif
which we possess do not enable us to fix the date precisely
He appears to have come to Rome at an early age, and t«
have got some work connected with the stage, in which hQ

managed to save money. He invested his savings in foreigq
trade (see line 331 note), and lost them. Being thus reduced teg
poverty he came back to Rome, and worked as a hired servan}
atamill; and it was at this time that he began to write playa
His literary career continued till his death, 184 13.0.; but we
do not know exactly when it began. Plautus, as might be
expected, makes little reference to contemporary events; and
there is nothing in his plays that points to a date earlier than
210-207 tac, In the Miles Glon‘osus (line 212) he speaks of
the imprisonment of Naevius, which appears to have taken
place at that time. Many of his plays may have been written
before the Miles3 for, if they were wanted for exhibition in the
year of the battle of the Metaurus, or in that immediately
preceding it, they may have found an audience all through the
second Punic War. ’

His Plays. In the days of the grammarian Varro (died 27
tae), no less than a hundred and thirty plays were attributed to
Plautus. Of these Varro considered twenty-one to be undoubt·
edly genuine3 and all but one (the Vidularia) on his list have
come down to us. The Tn‘nummus was adapted from the
θησαυρός of Philemon, and was first produced at the Megalesian
games not earlier than 194 lac (see line 990 note); the most
probable date is 188 Iac. In modern times it has been imitated
by Lessing in Schatz, as the Amphitruo by Moliere and Dryden
in plays of the same name, the A ulularia by Moliere in L’Avare,
and the Menaechmi (directly or indirectly) by Shakspeare in the
Comedy of Errors. The true spelling of the poet's name, which
used to be written incorrectly M. Accius Plautus, has been
recovered from the Ambrosiam palimpsest. His cognomen
Plautus means ‘flat-footed,’ and the additional name Asinius,
found in some Mss, is a corruption of Sassr'nas, ‘a native of
Sassina!
