xiv INTRODUCTION.

os the publica negotia (331), of the Clueutes (471), 01 the Syrian
and Campanian slaves (542, 545), 01 the dialect of Praeneste
(609), ol the dictator (695), 01 Neptune (820), 01 the aediles
(990), 01 the punishment of crucifixion (1040). Set by the side
01 these the mention 01 1121111111 Philippei (152), of the thousand
drachmae, owed to the banker olympic'us (425), 01 the two (not
three) guests on a couch at dinner (469), 01 bills of exchange
(982), of silver minae (1082), 01 the Piraeus, which Stasimus is
to reach without stopping (1103). To these we must add the
genuine Greek words employed, παῦσαι (117), οἴχεται (419),
πάλιν (705), ἐπιθήκη (102 5). Very similar, again, are Greek words
adopted into Latin, graplu'cus (1024), with its adverb graphice
(770), thermopolium (1013) with the barbarous thermopilare
(1014), paterium (1017), basilicus (1030). Note too words plainly
coined from the Greek, turpilucricupidus (100), vanidicus (275),
1011111121 (770).

' But, on the other hand, Plautus is thoroughly national and

original in the most striking characteristic of his dramas, in
plays upon words, in alliteration and assonance, and in asyn-
deta These were not, and indeed could not be, taken from
any foreign source; firstly, because they did not exist in the
Greek writers, from whom Roman Comedy horrowed; and
secondly, it would be as difficult to produce them by translation,
as to maintain a long conversation in a whisper. 11 maybe
worth while to cite the most striking instances. We find 11121121
ui id me 1221111 (27), raptores Ι1111111 11 peui (254), pal pudere
quam pigere praestat (345), 2 fine example 01 alliteration and
assonance combined, 1211101211 and 1201221 (354), 21 Veneris
vinctus (658), mares lominum moros 11 morosas efficit (669),laetus
1211111 laudes ago (821), besides 1003-4, 1011, and many others.
Asyndeton is common enough, eg. labitur liquitur (242), iu-
periis praeceptus (302), sarta tecta (317), mutumst tacet (1005).
Metaphors too must grow up naturally in a language3 they
would be unintelligible if they were imported into it; and so
we have either those which might belong to any language, eg.
love driving the lover into the toils (237), and the description
