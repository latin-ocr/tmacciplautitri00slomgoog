unmarried daughter to the care of his friend Callicles3 and,
before sailing, had secretly buried within his house a large sum
ofmoney. Α

Ι Lesbonicus, however, having spent all the money that could
be otherwise raised, put up the house for sale. Callicles, to
whom alone the secret of the treasure had been entrusted,
bought it for a small price and took up his abode therein.

Aet Ι. So. 1. At this point the action of the Play com-
