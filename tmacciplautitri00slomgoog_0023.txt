xviii INTRODUCTloM

approach oi Lysiteles and Lesbonicus, both much agitated.
An animated dialogue follows.

Aet ΠΙ. So. 2. Lysiteles endeavours to prevail on Lesbon-
icus not to insist upon the dowry: he forcibly depicts the im-
pending tuin of the family3 but Lesbonicus is proud and obsti·
nate: he cannot endure the thought of what his fellow-citizens
might say, were his sister, without a penny of her own, to marry
so rich a man ; and at last breaks away abruptly, followedby

. Lysiteles, Stasimus being left alone to paint in a few graphic

touches his probable future as a soldiers man-oi-all-work

Aot 111. So. 3. Meanwhile Callicles, acting on the advice
os Megaronides, determines to provide a dowry ior the young
lady from the hidden treasure. The difficulty is how to do
so without arousing the suspicions of Lesbonicus, who would
quickly make away with the remaining money if he became
aware oi its existence. Megaronides hits on the following
devioe. A man is to be hired to personate a messenger from
Charmides. The impostor is to pretend that he brings letters
and aremittance in money for Callicles; and then all will be
easily done. This plan is at once carried into effect.

Aet IV. So. 1. Charmides, however, unexpectedly appears
in person, having just landed at the Piraeus after ahad passage.
He dilates in some sonorous lines on the perils os the deep,
and is just about to enter his house when he encounffirs the
sham messenger, the Sycophant, enquiring for the *house of
Lesbonicus.

Aut IV. So. 2. In an amusing scene, CharmideS,wh0se suspi-
cionsare at once aroused‚ questions the Sycophant as to his name
and business. The Sycophant replies with evasive answers and
preposterous absurdities, though he makes no secret of his pre·
tended errand When challenged he cannot give the name of ‘his
friend’ who had entrusted the ‘ 1000 gold pieees' to his charge;
but even that only for a moment disturbs his sels-assurance.

At length Charmides discloses his identity, and demands the
money. The Sycophant is at first incredulous, and when finally
convinced covers his retreat with braren impudence.
