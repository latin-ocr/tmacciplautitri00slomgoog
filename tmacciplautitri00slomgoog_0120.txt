throughout: aud this has produced a similarly violent transition in
561, where there is uo question of a lacuna.

l. 599. latrocinatnm, ‘to serve as a mercenary' (latro is connected
with λάτρις, a servant). Cf. Mil. 499, aud Ter. Ad. 385 militatum.

Mam, used in the common and restricted sense, as it was after-

wards applied to the Roman Province. The word was not employed
to mean the continent till much later.

600. huo, to the house of Callicles.

601. hio, Callicles himself.

. Aer ΙΙΙ. &unu 1.

Stasimus has told Callicles the news about the proposed marriage of
Lysiteles with theuudowered sister of Lesbonicus. Callicles, hardly able
to believe the story, requires Stasimus to repeat it, aud then goes off to
ask the advice of Megaronides. Stasimus is beginning a soliloquy when
he is interrupted by the approach of Lysiteles and Lesbonicus, both
apparently much agitated.

Line 602. nostrum erilem fllium, a common expression=n0srri
erifilr‘um.
i 603. em, hoo modo. Stasimus speaks testily.
' 604. quoi homini ; for hiatus after quoi cf. 358.
' 605. incantas divitias (cf. 1133),‘into so wealthyafamily.' The
phrase also occurs Cist. a. 3. 573 Poen. 4. 2. 82. Marriages both in
Athens and Rome were commonly arranged by the heads of the families
(as iu the Phormio and at the end of this play) and the dowry was
always a primary matter for consideration. Itwas thought a downright
disgrace to a family, if an adequate dowry was not given with a
daughter who married a man of property. That a girl actually penui·
less should make such a match seemed to Callicles scarcely credible.

606. nullus, sometimes used for non by Plautus and Terence. cf.
Ter. Eun. 216 (where see Donatns’ note); Cic. Attio. 11. ²4· 4.

meduan, archaic for credas. Two archaic forms of the present

subjunctive of credo are found: crcduam, creduas, creduat; creduis,
creduit. No plural is found of these forms. Cf. 436 note.

607. credidero ; for the tense cf. 60 note.

nihilipendere. Cf. flocci sa'cere 211. Stasimus hates Callicles

for his supposed treachery to Charmides (cf. 600), and so gives free play
to his impertinence.

608. quam dudum? ‘how long agoi’ cf. roro; dudum also means
‘alittle while ago,' or merely‘formerly.’ Cf. Ter. And. 5915 Phor. 459.
