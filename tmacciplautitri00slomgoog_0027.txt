Any monosyllabic preposition may be shortened by dropping
its final consonant, e. g. ab and ad may be scanned 6, ex as ὅ,
etc. Final a, ὃ, 1, ὃ, are all occasionally shortened both in
nouus and verbs.

11. The shortening of an unaccented syllable in order to
throw all the stress on the accented syllable is thus expressed
in aformulaby Wagner o-La ota-'2 andin trochaics Lo- a
d-w. This occurs most frequently at the beginning of a verse.
Instances are ferlntdrium 4 56, volzlntdte 1166, quid 111111110-
pellatio 709, potlst fleri 730, tablrnciculo 726, dedistln 129, si
mage lxlgere 1052, sed {stile 88, quid istic 573, hic quoque hinc
abiit 718, quia dmnls 78. Brix and Wagner maintain that lna'e
and rlnde may be shortened, even when standing at the begin-
ning of a line in trochaic mette.

ΙΙΙ. 8111110011( Any case' of meus, tuus, suus may be mono·
syllabic—in fact almost any two vowels coming together may
be thus contracted: eg. zi, cTus, mmm, ῑᾶ1,νὶῑ, dicis, dus,

To show how greatly scansion depended on accent eius, buius,
quoius, are indifferently used as trochees, pyrrhics, 01 1110110-
syllables. Compounds in which two vowels come together
are regularly contracted, e. g. promptare. Double letters were
probably not written in the time ol PlautuS, and consequently .
vowels when unaccented are freely shortened before double
consonants: dcculto 712, dccejr‘sti 964, 1011111111833,Ρ111”Ιζῇ-
peus152.

Archaic longterminations are occasionallyretainedby Plautus
(rarelybyTerence) where the rhythm of the verse requires them:
eg. familia (nom. sing.) 251;-ῡν(ωρ) 111 110111. sing. olnouns
and comparative adjectives 2263-bus in dat. and abl. plur.; and
the verb endings is (eis), at (aar), et (eit), it (iit) : cf. 206. Es

(from sum) is always long in Plautus.
Hiatus is generally acknowledged to be admitted by Plautus,
(1) Where the line is divided among two or more speakers,

= θ4111312111010 there isa distinct pause in the sense, eg. 185,1018;
