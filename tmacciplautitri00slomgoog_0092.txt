Were the MSS. better and more numerous, words found in all could not
be thus rejected. But in the case ol Plautus, probably the only MSS.
in existence were actor's copies, and these would be very likely to have
emendations or amplificatione os the text written on the margins, and by
later copyists incorporated with the text itsels. The present words are
just such as an actor might have inserted in order to let the audience
know the name oi Megaronides. See Introduction on the MSS. oi
Plautus
