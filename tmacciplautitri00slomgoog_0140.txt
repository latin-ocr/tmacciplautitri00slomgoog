1V·³·4⁶·59· NOTES. LINES 1024-1066. 111

1. 1050. exigere, ‘dnn for it ;’ a much stronger word than repetas.
duarum rerum exoritur optio is the main epodosis, the indica·
tive expressing a positive fact: this is amplified by the two following
clauses, which are subjunctive, as each indicates a possible result of si
occepias exigere. The general sense of the last two lines is,·if you
press for the repayment of a loan, either you will be met with a down·
right refusal, or, if successful, you will turn your former friend into an
enemy? But the lines are feeble, and the second seems an awkward
repetition of 1051. Possibly both are interpohted, end represent one
or two lines lost after 1051.
¹054- venerit. Indirect, ⁴(do you ask) how this has occurred to
mel' .
re ipre is explained by 1056.

1057. rebus 01110111 publicis. The dative after curare is not found
in the classical writers, hut occurs several times in Plautus, e. g. Rudens
146,182.

1058. meo tergo tutelam geram, ‘act as guardian to my own
111011; tutelam gerere being a phrase which sometimes means to take
charge of a ward? ef. 870.

1⁰59· Short dialogues. such as that contained' ιιι the' nine following
lines, where two persons meet rn a street, and one of them does not
know to whom heis talking, are common in Plautus and Terence, but
it must have been diffimlt to represent them on the stage without some
air of unreality. Stasimus, setting off home, may have got round the
street comer; but even then he would not have sustained an argument
without looking to see with whom he was conversing.

10 volo. Cf. 516 note.

1060. eh nimium, etc,⁴gent1y,gently,Stasimus! Adverbs in -e'ter,
formed from adjectives in -us, are common in early Latin, e. g. avariter.
ame'ez'ter, munditer3 later the termination ·e became usual: humaniter
and naviter are, however, exceptions to this usage 3 and it should be
noted that saeve is very rare.

1061. quid ego=quia¹ agam, deliberative.

magnum malum. Cf. 1045 note.
1063. ὁι. Cf. 47 note.
obnoxius, ‘under obligation’ Cf 269 note.

1066. quia boni, etc.‚‘because the good and bad thereos is partly
yours.' The phrase is ambiguous. Charmides means ‘you are one of
my slaves; therefore their goodness or badness depends partly on yon,'
but Stasimus, understanding mali in the sense of magnum errulum
(10601 says that Charmides may lreep it (partem alteram) 101 himself,
and give to Stasimus the good (illam alteram quod torret).
