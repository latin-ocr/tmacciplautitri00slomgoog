L1183. calliolstis. The MSS. give Callicli, which follows the analogy
of Ulixi, Themistocli, etc.. but the change is necessitated by the mette.
The use os the genitive etis is certain, though not proved sor the age
os Plautus.

1185. miseria nna. For this sentiment, cf. 42-65. The hiatus
after aclsatim is justified hythe change of speaker.

1187. ei facies modo, ⁴(we11 and good), is yon carry it out?

1189. Cantor. the singen who had to rccite the parts of the play set
to music. while the actor accompanied him with appropriate gestures.
He appeared at the end os the Play, and said to the audience, vos valeto
et plaudite or plaudite. Cf. Hor. Α. P. 155. In this play of Plautus
and in all' those os Terence the MSS. mark the Cantor by ω. The
actors are often indicated (as in B) by letters of the Greek alphabet;
the Cantor, therefore, who appeared at the end oi all, is indicated by
the last letter oi all.
