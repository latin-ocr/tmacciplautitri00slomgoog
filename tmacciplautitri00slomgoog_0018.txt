-Neoeeearily hybrid character ot Roman comedy. Ro-
man Comedy in the hands of Plautus shows evidence enough
of its hybrid origin. ln transferring Greek dramas to the Roman

stage it was quite impossible for the adapter to keep clear of
inconsistencies, unless he were willing to latinize the piece
thoroughly, not only in language, but in names, scene, and
character. This course was out of the question. Τὴε public
opinion of Rome was still quite capable of being shocked3 and
’ it would have caused a scandal, followed by unpleasant conse·
quences to the author, if the careless libertinism of decaying
Greece had been attributed unblushingly to the countrymen of
Cincinnatus, Fabricius, and Fabius. Besides this, the cunning
slave—the character to whom the audience looked most confi·
dently for amusement-could not be naturalised arnid Roman
surroundings. Even on the stage at Athens he must have been
considered an exaggeration, though an exaggeration in which
the spectators could easily recognise the original. But at Rome,
where the slave was looked upon as a mere chattel, he would
have seemed not merely a parody, but an impossibility. lt
would have been interesting indeed to watch the face of some
stem master like Cato, while he was being treated by his slave
with the impertinence which Stasimus shows to Callicles, or
even with the friendly familiarity with which he receives Char·
mides ou his return. lt was impossible, therefore, to give a
genuine Roman colouring to Greek Comedy without sacrificing
half the fun of it in the process. Plautus, however, does not
merely admit this necessary incongruity, involved in the dress·
ing up of a Greek drama in the Latin language ; he goes further,
and, unlike Terence, intrudes into the streets of Athens, amid
Greek scenes and Greek characters, allusions to the gods, the
laws, the magistrates, and the localities of Rome.
illustratione from the 'Irinummua lt is worth while to
refer to the most striking passages in the Tn'nummus which
illustrate this point. First, some distinctly Roman allusions
may be noticed ;-the crowning of the Lar familiam (39), the
mention of the Capitolian Jove (84), of the'larpeianRock urbm,
