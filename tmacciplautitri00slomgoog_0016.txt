INTRODUCTION. xi

from the Old hythe fact that its interest lies in the incidente
of domestic life, and not in the representation of contemporary
history. These dramas would tell us, if we had them, little
or nothing about Athens itself, but a good deal about the
Athenians. They were full of love intrigues3 and the pair of
fathers, one mild and the other severe; the pair of sons, one
moderately virtuous and the other very much the reverse3 the
cunning slave and the time-serving parasite, were the stock
characters of every piece. ln their Latin dress-the only form
in which we know them as wholes-their utter want of moral
purpose, combined witha dull uniformity of plot, would make
them the most dismal reading in the world, if they were not
relieved by really comic incidents, and a good deal of broad
fun in the dialogues. Of the originals, however, only fragments
remain; though the names of sinay-four poets are mentioned
as belonging to this period; and one of thern alone, Philemon,
wrote ninety Plays. The most important of these writers are
Philemon of Soli, Diphilus of Sinope, Apollodorus of Carystos,
and, most famous of all, Menander of Athens.

Adepted by Roman writers. Plautus This was the
material on which the Roman play-wrights went to work. The
first Latin comedy was performed on the Roman stage 240
tae, the year following the close of the First Punic War. lt
was adapted from the Greek by Livius Andronicus, himself
a Greek taken at Tarentum. Five years later Gnaeus Naevius,
probably a Campanian, brought out the first of his long series
of dramas, famous for the strength and purity of their language3
and also for the violence with which their author, alone among
Roman writers imitating the true spirit of the Old Comedy,
assailed public men. The offence which he gave to the Me-
telli caused his imprisonment and subsequent banishment.
But the poet who was destined to leave a real monument in
the history of his country, and whose fame so far-eclipsed his
contemporaries that a hundred years later their plays were
mostly attributed to him, was Titus Maccius Plautus.
