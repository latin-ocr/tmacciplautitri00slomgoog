the threshold of his house by the approach of Stasimus, who,
being in great trouble about Lesbonicus, has added one more

ἶ to his misfortunes by losing his ring at a wine shop. The
' master amuses himself for a few minutes with the half-drunken

platitudes of his slave before Stasimus is aware ofhis presence.
Tben all the bad news comes upon him at once.

The recklessness of his son, the ruin of his property, the sale
of his house, the supposed treachery of his friend-all these
calamities overcome him and he well nigh saints away.

Callicles, spade in hand, from digging up the treasure. Char·

Aot V. So. 3. The Play ends happily with the forgiveness
