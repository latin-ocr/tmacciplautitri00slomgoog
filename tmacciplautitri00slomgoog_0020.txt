os good principles as the integunrentum uriae (313) ; or such as
are distinctly Roman, e. g. serentan'um amicum (456), os quoi
sublmat (558), and concentun'ant metum (1002).

As we do not possess anything but fragments of the New

Comedy‚·from which the Roman dramatists borrowed‚ it is
impossible to estimare the amount of originality, which belongs

to any play ol Plautus taken as a whole; but the ease and
vigour of his language would show clearly that he was treating
his models with some freedom, if this sact were not also evident
from the numerous Roman allusions‚ to which reference has
already been made.

Plautus und his audienoo. Plautus' early connexion with
the stage gave him the experience requisite for writing a good
acting play. We see it in the broad humour of the dialogues,
in the variety of the action, and in the dramatic character ol the
situations. And, besides, he knew well for whom he was writing;
and his audience was not ol a high class. The greater the
extravagance, the more amusement it gave; and it is to the
knowledge of this that we must attribute the productiori of part
os the fourth act of the Tnitummus. We can imagine how the
excitable spectators screamed with laughter when the Syco-
phant calmly declared that Arabia was in Pontus, and how
eagerly they waited to see if his effrontery would support
him in declaring that he had positively been introduced to
Jove.

Appreoletion of Plautus. The popularity of Plautus con-
tinued very great for some time after his death, until his plays
were gradually superseded by the more polished comedy of
T erence. Cicero, however (de Off. i. 29), classes his wit with
the Atticorum antt'qua comedia ; but in the last years of the
Republic and the early years of the Empire the rhetorical
character of education led men to prefer tragedy to comedy.
Horace acknowledges the general appreciation of the vivacity
of style and action so conspicuous in Plautus ; for (Epist. ii. 1.
58) he says dr‘citur. . . Plautus ad exemplar Siculi properare
Epz'cltarmi3 but his own opinion is drsparaging &menno-on.
