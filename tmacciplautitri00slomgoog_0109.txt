1. 344. deiuvare, ἅπαξ icy.

545. ‘Indeed shaming is better than blaming oueself by every letter ,
of the word? A strong way of assertiug that pudere is in every vray
better than pigere. To translate ‘though the number of letters is the
same, ' is possible, but lauhs point.

348. ut pudeat must be explained hythe general sense of thepre·
ceding words: ‘do not blame yourself for having aided a friendt (blane
yourself so little) that you ra'ther feel shame: etc.

350. immonni (rather than' rnmuni here as well as in ι4, hutnot ’
even there rs it warranted hythe MSS.; Lucretius hes manera three
times). This word has three meanings in the play, (1) ‘which getr ιο
moenera,' i.e. ‘thankless,' in 24; (ι) ‘who gives no moenera’ 'te- ,
‘stingy,' in 3503 (3) ‘who does no moenera' (duties), in 354. In the
last two there is a play on the double sense of the word: ‘do you lnov
the lines so often quoted at the man who will part with nothing,' end
then 354: he has no part ru life who has not the wherewithel to pet·
form hrs part

cantari. Cf. 287; but perhaps here there rs some notionof
quoting a song.

solet. Colloquialuse. In other than comio writers thesyntax

A. gives velim malum. Both words cannot stand. If the latteris
adopted, it can be taken with illud, or, as a vocative, ‘wretch ς’ hut it
looks very like the addition of some commentator to explain the phrase

' qurdnonhabcs.

352. pote=potes here, and in a few more instances in Plautus. It
seems to be found also for posse. Patr for potest is very commonia
Latin. See Munro, Lucr. 5. 836.

-0hurmidut. This form of the genitive is found in Plautus,
for proper names in -cr, for nouns of the first declension in -ο
(often), and occasionally for the feminine adjective, cg. magnas·
Mil. ¹03· Terence has no instance of it. See Pany ou Terence
And ι. 6. 8. (439). Lucretius uses it for the substantive very
often; for the adjective three times. Virgil has aulai, aurai, aquai,

pictai.
