vl PREFACE.

intended to represent concisely some oi the more important
results of modern research on ,this difficult subject. The
materials have been mainly drawn from Wagner's Introduc-
tion to the Aulularia, and Introduction to the Trinummus of
J. Brix.

It is hoped that the scenic directions, partly suggested by
stage experience at Westminster, may be oi some service in
the intelligent reading oi the play.

For aid in the exposition of the text we are under great
obligations to the admirable edition oi the Trinummus by
Julius Brix. We have also consulted the notes of W. Wagner,
Lindemann and others.

It is hardly necessary to mention that in matters oi textual
criticism we have on all occasions made use of F. Ritschl's
’ elaborate collation oi the MSS.

PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.

Tria demand for a new edition enables us to make a few
alterations and corrections, which we owe chiefly to the
kindness of our colleagues at Westminster. .
