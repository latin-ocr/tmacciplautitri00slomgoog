1v. a. μη. utores, nirves 990-1023. 109

1. 1010. ‘step out,' hurry up 3 it is long since you have lest home.'

1011. cottabi. As the noise of the falling wine was the chief feature
of the Greek geme of κότταβος, Stasimus uses the word to represent the
cowhide falling on his shoulders. The effect is greatly heightened by
the alliteration.

1013. satin. Cf. 925 note. thermopolim is the Greek θερμοπὼλκον,
but thermopdtnre is a hybrid word, got from the Latin potare (observe
the disserence of quantity). Some vulgarism, such as ‘swillingshop’
and ‘swilled’ may serve for translation.

1014. guttum, masculine, as in the two other passages where
Plautus uses the word, Mil. 835, Aul. 30²· cf. papaverem 41⁰·

1015. recurre petere. The infinitive is often used by Plautus after
verbs of motion. Terence has it atter mittere. Eun. 528.

re recenti. ‘While the loss is still fresh!
’ 1016. gurguliost exercitor, ‘has his gullet for driver,’ i. e. he stag·
gers about like a drunken man.

1017. tribusne te poteriis, etc, ‘(are you not ashamed) to have
lost your memory atter three glasses l’ poterium is the Gr. ποτήριον.

1018. Most editors place 1022 before 1020,1021. The order of the
MSS. (given in the text) may be kept, if we consider 1020, 1021, as
parenthetical. Stasimus, vrho is partly drnnk‚ goes off into reflections
about the frugi homines, before he compleres the construction. Τὴε
hiatus aster oblitum can be explained by the stop.

1020. ‘close-fist, Cocktail, Catch-crumb, Crib-ring. Cakeling‚ Clatter·

ζ necks, Clatter·shins.' These are comic names, which Stasimus invents

l

sor his companions

cunuchus :d χεῖρας ἔχων.

cerconicus is from κέρκος (a taill, and νικόω, a componnd to
which no very obvious sense seems to attach.

crinnua may be κρίμνον, ‘a crumb’ by assimilation of m, though
κρίνον (a lily) is given by Pollux, a writer of the second century A.11.‚ as
an equivalent for a needy man. ’

Collebus (ndhhcssor=‘ a small cake '), is best suited to the former.

Oricolabur=t κρίκον (ring) λαβών.

1021. collierepidue, cruricrepidae, ‘rnen whose necks and legs
rattle with chains’ These are ἅπαξ λεγ.; as also ferriteri, 'men, who
are galled with letters’ (ferrum-tero).
