third foot (the penthemimeral caesura) is osten preserved. The
Iambic Trimeter is ordinarily employed when the dialogue is
not specially excited.

Π. ¹I'he Trochulo uotrameter Getuleotlo consiste in its
pure form of seven trochees and a halt ln the comic poets
the Tribrach‚¹ Spondee, Anapaest, and Dactyl are pennitted in
,any foot except the seveuth, where only the Trochee, Tribrach‚
and sometimes Dactyl are found. This metre usually has a
